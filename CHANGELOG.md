### Added

- A triangle mesh (.obj), the naive labeling (.txt) and a glTF model (.glb) are included for all models. The .obj can be downloaded directly from the README.
- Links to visualize the 3D model with [3dviewer.net](https://3dviewer.net/) ([kovacsv/Online3DViewer](https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer))
- `cuboid_tray_with_step` model
- `encrusted_cube` model
- `conjoined_twins` model
- `7-connected` model
- `8-connected` model
